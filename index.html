        <h2> Summary </h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li> Hello, welcome to my LinkedIn profile! </li>    <br>

        <li> I am a passionate individual currently pursuing a B.Tech in 
            Computer Science Core Engineering from VIT, Vellore. With a 
            versatile personality and a keen eye for creativity, I find joy 
            in exploring various avenues of self-expression. From traditional 
            forms of painting to the technical realm of UI designing, I embrace 
            the fusion of art and technology. </li>    <br>
            

        <li> As a multilingual individual, I possess fluency in three languages: 
            English, French and Hindi. This linguistic diversity allows me to 
            connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds, 
            fostering a global perspective in my work and interactions. </li>    <br> 

        <li> With my academic pursuits in computer science, I am equipped with 
            a strong foundation in programming languages and software 
            development. However, it is my passion for design and aesthetics 
            that truly sets me apart. Whether it's crafting an intuitive user 
            interface or creating a captivating painting, I thrive on blending
             my technical skills with my innate sense of artistic flair. </li>   <br>

        <li> I believe in continuously expanding my horizons and staying 
            up-to-date with the latest industry trends. By combining my 
            technical expertise and creative mindset, I strive to bring 
            innovative and visually appealing solutions to the table. </li> <br>
                                   
        <li> If you are seeking a dynamic team player who can bridge the gap 
            between technology and design, I would be thrilled to connect and 
            explore potential opportunities. Let's collaborate and create 
            something remarkable together! </li> <br>
